# Twitterplus

Integrated view of Twitter and Google+ feeds.

Toy project for learning AngularJS.

To try out:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. open http://localhost:8000/app
4. Enter Twitter handle and Google+ name. (They are currently irrelevant because only static demo data is shown.)

Todo:

* Nicer page formatting.
* Sort results by date.
* Unit tests.
* Continuous integration with Travis CI.
* Integration tests.
* Real API access using OAuth.
* Implement API access on server side so that secrets don't leak to client.
* Post Tweets to Google+ and vice versa.
